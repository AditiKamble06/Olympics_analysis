In this project, I have analysed the Data of Olympics right from it;s begging (1896) till 2020. As the olympics are going on this project can help us better understand the trends of Olympics in all these years. 
Dataset used https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/josephcheng123456/olympic-historical-dataset-from-olympediaorg/data .
This dataset contained various CSV files with messy data, which I preprocessed to gain better insights.
